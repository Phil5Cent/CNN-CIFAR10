# CNN-CIFAR10
This is a convolutional neural network creation model designed to recognize images from the CIFAR 10 dataset and identify them. 

NOTE: This does not contain the original datasets, which can be found online at https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

Validation accuracy of approximately 86% was achieved after creating a model from scratch. This was achieved after optimizing with a number of tools to prevent overfitting including dropouts, data augmentation, dynamic maxpooling/filters/dense layers, and autotuners.
